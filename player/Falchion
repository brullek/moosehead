Vers 31
LnD  A Gladiator~
Desc A mighty silver dragon looks at you with the patience of the near immortal.  He lowers his head and bows respectively.  This loyal follower of Matook smiles warmly at you and you feel that he would be willing to help you any way he can.
His armor matches his scales, making it hard to look directly at him as the sun shines off directly into your eyes.
You see two banners held high and proudly from his back.  The Order of the Dragon and, even higher, Matook.
He bows again and awaits your instructions.
