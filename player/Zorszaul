Vers 31
Desc To parents, as all children are, Zorszaul was born.
His parents, however, were not as all parents, they
were both mages, both power hungry, seeking to further
their personal power by choosing each other as mates.
Normal enough, save they were siblings, brother and
sister. They thought if they mixed their two bloods,
powerful as they already were, they would give birth
to an offspring who would unite their powers, and be
twice the magician they were. They were wrong. Instead,
giving birth to a feeble-minded fool, an oaf worthy only
for house chores and fieldwork. They revelled in his
torture. They would charge their mage friends to come over
and practice their magic on him, chained in the cellar,
beaten, demeaned, and lost...

While being beaten one day, in the fields, by the field
master, a thin string in his mind snapped, and he flew
into an uncontrollable rage. Using his clenched fist, he
cranialed the fieldmaster, crushing his skull into a dozen
pieces. Freedom was his. He made his escape, and ended
up tired, hungry, and exhausted in the hands of a farmer
and his family, who lived near his evil parents.

This family nursed Zorszaul back into health, and he lived
with them for a time, helping them around the farm and slowly
learning the ways of civilized peoples. One night, around a
campfire, a traveller told tales of a great city, ruled by a
fair Sultan. Zorszaul had never been to the city. The traveller's
tales made him excited. Zorszaul bid his farewells, and was off
the following day. With a note from the traveller, which he
could not read, Zorszaul set to find the Warrior's Guildmaster
in New Thalos.

Too unruly for civilized training of any kind, the Guildmaster 
sent Zorszaul to a wary colleague, Thrym. Not usually open to
new students, Thrym reluctantly trained Zorszaul, until he was
able to return to the Guildmaster. Zorszaul learned the ways of the
warrior, but always kept in his heart, the lessons of the mages
who bore him. In time, his fear tured to hate. In time his hate
turned to rage.

Zorszaul's new life must hold purpose. At times of lull and
respite, he would often dream of what it would be like to be
normal, like everyone else. His dwarfed features and oddly
pronounced words often are a source of embarrassment for him.
He is not so dumb as not to see that he is stupid and 
feebleminded, and it shames him. Zorszaul seeks to change
this, though he'd not tell a soul about his inadequacies,
for fear he'd look weak in his brothers' eyes. Somewhere,
someway, he knows he'll find a way to become normal, and
lift his curse of inbred enfeeblement.
