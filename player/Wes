Vers 14
Desc In the history of the world there have been 5 heroes that have been considered the most heroic.
Thes men, (and one woman) have come to be known for the strength of thier swordarms, the purity of thier hearts, the canniness of thier wit, and the nobility of thier grace.
Wesley was not yet among these 5, actually, he was running about 16th and this was mostly on sheer potential.
However, he was young, and beginning to shape his own destiny, to travel to the new world, and make his name to return to marry his love.
In time, he would become the first among the five, a hero so known that hero was a term that when one though of it, they though of him. But let us get on with the story.

Wesley has flashing blue eyes, and blond hair. His arms and chest are toned as the result of years of farm labor. He looks at you, and replies to your request...

"As you wish."
