Vers 31
Desc Before you stands a young maiden.  She is completely enchanting.
Mackenzie stands tall, with long legs which are only covered by
a small pair of silk boxers which move softly against her in the wind.
Around her waist lays her dagger, wrapped lazily around.
Her black tank top is torn and faded, showing only a mere fraction
of her previous battles.  Her face is streaked with dirt.
She is smiling though; her red lips are shining from the lip
gloss she wears.  Her green eyes seem to sparkle brightly
in the glaring sunlight.  She stares at you and you fall deeply into
her spell.  She has a mischievious, playful look on her face.
Her red curls fall to her shoulders.  A few bouncing strands fall over
into her face, but she quickly pushes them aside to show her
radiant smile.

Softly, she takes your hands and says,
"Hello, my name is Mackenzie, nice to meet you."
