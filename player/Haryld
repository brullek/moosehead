ShD  Haryld the BFG!~
LnD  Also plays Aggro, Rede, and monopoly badly.
~
Desc Very big? Glowing? Poofs in and out? It must be Haryld.
He's well over 16 feet tall, muscular, and all of
his armor is polished to a relective sheen.

He calls himself the BFG- big, friendly, giant.
It fits.

Graven into his huge shining shield is his motto: GTBOS
Scribed below, it says- Glad to be of service.

As you start to glance away you notice one final thing
a tagline, and a reminder: "Always pillage before you burn"

Bout Haryld strikes the air before him, rending it. He steps through the hole        created. It seals after him with a whoosh and a pop.~
