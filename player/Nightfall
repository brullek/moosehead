Vers 14
Desc A demon wakens with the night, Reviling sun and all things bright
Evil's friend and virtue's foe- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

Eyes darker than the midnight shade, Teeth sharper than the headman's blade.
When he smiles a cold wind blows- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

When shadows fall and sunlight breaks, What Nightfall touches, Nightfall takes.
Lives and silver, maids in bows- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

A demon cruel; A monster stark, Grim moonlight, coldness, deepest dark.
Nightmares come to those that doze- In darkness where old Nightfall goes.

Nightfall laughs, and death's ax falls, Hell opens wide and swallows all.
He rules the depths where no light shows- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

Lock up your children after dark, lest Nightfall find an easy mark.
For safety ends at twilight's close- And darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

Razor claws and firey eyes, Leathern wings to cleave the skies.
His soul within stark midnight froze- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

Those who brave the night will find, Horror, Dread, and Demon kind.
He slays them all and rends their souls- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

Birthed within the black abyss, his silent gift, a deadly kiss.
Gone before the rooster crows- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

Counting years like grains of sand, Countless fall beneath his hand.
Time, his minion; Night, his clothes- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

Where Nightfall walks, all virtue dies, He weaves a trail of pain and lies.
On mankind heaps his vilest woes- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

Wolves and bats and beasts of night, Spirits black that flee the light.
Cringed in fear when he arose- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

He feeds on elders and children, On soldiers, kings, and beggarmen.
He never stops and never slows- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes.

The Evil One, the demon blight, Who hides in day and stalks the night.
He steals the stars and lays them low- Darkness comes where Nightfall goes...

Darkness comes, where Nightfall goes...
